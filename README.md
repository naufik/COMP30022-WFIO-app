# Don't Lose Your Way

This was a submission for the capstone project ([COMP30022 IT Project](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2018/subjects/comp30022)) in university of Melbourne. This project is sadly no longer functional due to API keys.

## Project Summary

The project is an Android app with a small pitch:

- A mobile application to help elderly people go from **Point A to Point B** where they can be connected to another carer. The application must have voice and text chat functionalities.

With a small team of five:
